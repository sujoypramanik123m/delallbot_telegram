## Deployment Checklist

- *MongoDB Setup*: Ensure MongoDB is accessible from your Docker container. Adjust `DB_URL` in `config.py` to match your setup.
- *API Credentials*: Replace placeholders in `config.py` with actual Telegram API credentials and log channel ID.
- *Permissions*: Ensure the bot has necessary admin permissions in the channels/groups it is added to.

## Testing

Before deploying, test the bot locally to ensure:
- The `/delall` and `/delfrom` commands work correctly and are restricted to admins in both groups and channels.
- The `/broadcast` command functions smoothly for private messages, groups, and channels, restricted to the bot owner.
- The bot achieves high speed in message deletion.

With these modifications, your bot should be ready for deployment without errors. If you encounter any issues during deployment or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
